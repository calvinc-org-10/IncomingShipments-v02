Yes, in PySide6's `QtSql` module, you can have multiple database connections open simultaneously. Each connection is identified by a unique name, and you can specify which connection to use when executing queries.

Here’s how you can manage two database connections and send queries to each:

### Step 1: Create and Open Two Database Connections
You need to create two separate database connections using `QSqlDatabase.addDatabase()`. Each connection should have a unique name.

```python
from PySide6.QtSql import QSqlDatabase, QSqlQuery

# Create the first database connection
db1 = QSqlDatabase.addDatabase("QSQLITE", "connection1")  # "connection1" is the unique name for this connection
db1.setDatabaseName("path_to_database1.db")  # Set the path to your first database
if not db1.open():
    print("Failed to open database 1")
    exit(1)

# Create the second database connection
db2 = QSqlDatabase.addDatabase("QSQLITE", "connection2")  # "connection2" is the unique name for this connection
db2.setDatabaseName("path_to_database2.db")  # Set the path to your second database
if not db2.open():
    print("Failed to open database 2")
    exit(1)
```

### Step 2: Execute Queries on Each Database
To execute queries on a specific database, you need to create a `QSqlQuery` object and associate it with the desired connection by passing the connection name.

```python
# Query for the first database
query1 = QSqlQuery(db1)  # Associate query1 with db1
if not query1.exec("SELECT * FROM table1"):
    print("Query 1 failed:", query1.lastError().text())

# Query for the second database
query2 = QSqlQuery(db2)  # Associate query2 with db2
if not query2.exec("SELECT * FROM table2"):
    print("Query 2 failed:", query2.lastError().text())
```

### Step 3: Process the Results
You can process the results of each query as usual.

```python
# Process results from query1
while query1.next():
    # Access data using query1.value()
    print("DB1 Result:", query1.value(0))

# Process results from query2
while query2.next():
    # Access data using query2.value()
    print("DB2 Result:", query2.value(0))
```

### Step 4: Close the Connections (Optional)
When you’re done, you can close the connections.

```python
db1.close()
db2.close()
```

### Notes:
- Replace `"QSQLITE"` with the appropriate driver for your database (e.g., `"QMYSQL"`, `"QPSQL"`, etc.).
- Replace `"path_to_database1.db"` and `"path_to_database2.db"` with the actual paths or connection details for your databases.
- Always check for errors when opening databases and executing queries.

This approach allows you to manage multiple database connections and execute queries on each independently.
